        Mosiah 3

        19 "For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall
        of Adam, and will be forver and ever, unless he yeilds to the Holy 
        Spirit and putteth of the natural man and becometh a saint through 
        the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submisive, 
        meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things 
        which the Load seeth  fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth 
        submit to hid father."
